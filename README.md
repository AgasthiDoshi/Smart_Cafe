- Staff attendance (Punch In / Punch Out)
- Secure login authentication
- Excel export for attendance logs
## üìå Features
- üîê **Login Authentication** (Username & Password)
- üìã **Interactive Menu Interface**
- üõí **Order Placement Window**
- üßë‚Äçüíº **Staff Attendance Tracker**
- üìä **Attendance Logging to Excel**
- ü™Ñ Clean and Responsive GUI using `Swing`

## Key Findings 
- Digital Cafe Automation: Successfully built a GUI-based cafe management system using Java Swing to automate common operations like menu display, order processing, and staff attendance.
- Excel-Based Attendance Logging: Implemented real-time attendance tracking where staff Punch In/Out logs are recorded directly in an Excel file for easy monitoring by the manager.
- Structured Codebase: Modularized the code with separate Java classes for Menu, Orders, Attendance, and GUI, ensuring easy readability and maintenance.
## Conclusion
The Smart Cafe Management System demonstrates a strong understanding of Java GUI programming and modular application design. It provides a practical and efficient solution for small to medium-sized cafes to streamline their operations. With real-time billing, a dynamic menu, and automated staff attendance logging, this project shows potential for real-world scalability.
